This is python program uses [Pillow Module](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Random Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to generate quote images dynamically like how a NFT wouldve been generated.

- ✔️ Collected the quotes (in my cases it is bible verses) from my friends via google excel
- ✔️ Downloaded the excel file and converted it to json
- ✔️ Created a python program to generate the posts
- ✔️ Shuffled the json datas
- ✔️ Use random module, to randomly select the bgs and color combinations
